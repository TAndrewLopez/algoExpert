# Algorithmic Thinking - MOST IMPORTANT

Approach to problem solving that involves breaking a problem down into a clearly defined input and output. Along with a distinct set of steps that solves the problem by going to input to output.

## Solving Problems

- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.
- The steps also need to be distinct.
- The algorithm should produce a result.
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.
